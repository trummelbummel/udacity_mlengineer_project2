# ML Ops ML Engineer Udacity Project 

After the AutoML run, which we run on an instantiated compute cluster, we select the best model and deploy it in an azure container instance.
Several steps that are important to provide the model results to endusers are taken:
1. Providing documentation via Swagger UI.
2. Logging to inform about any abnormalities like e.g. server errors due to timeouts or internal server errors depending on the error code.
2. Testing the endpoint by querying the HTTP endpoint over which the responses are provided to the user.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
